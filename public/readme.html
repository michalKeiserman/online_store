    <td>what was hard to do?</td>
    <td>we had only two weeks to build the website
      due to personal reasons, so we tried to do
      our best and learn as much as possible.
      the interaction of the frontend with the
      backend was hard to me at first, but after
      trying, failing, and keep on trying - the magic worked.
      it was the best experience for me so far in this degree,
      so thank you.</td>
